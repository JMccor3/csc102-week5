        <!-- This is how I began to change the world-->
        <p>1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that address real-world situations and
                challenges.
                <br>
                <!-- This is proof of my robot's nervous system-->
        <p>2. Demonstrate embedded microprocessor system skills such as microcontroller selection, digital logic design,
                schematic
                creation, printed circuit board layout and construction, electromagnetic compatibility design and
                manufacturing design.
                <br>
                <!-- This is how my robot will see-->
        <p>3. Develop vision and sensing systems for use in robotic applications.
                <br>
                <!-- This is a list of the guts of my robot-->
        <p>4. Integrate transducers, actuators, feedback and other mechanical systems into robotic platforms.
                <br>
                <!-- This is how my robot will be controlled-->
        <p>5. Apply examples of human and autonomous control systems into robotic platforms.
                <br>
                <!-- This will show my robot has a brain-->
        <p>6. Implement artificial intelligence and data systems into robotic platforms.
